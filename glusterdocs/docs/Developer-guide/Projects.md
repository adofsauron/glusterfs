Projects/Features which needs contributors
------------------------------------------


### RIO

Issue: https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/issues/243

This is a new distribution logic, which can scale Gluster to 1000s of nodes.


### Composition xlator for small files

Merge small files into a designated large file using our own custom
semantics. This can improve our small file performance.


### Path based geo-replication

Issue: https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/issues/460

This would allow remote volume to be of different type (NFS/S3 etc etc) too.


### Project Quota support

Issue: https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/issues/184

This will make Gluster's Quota faster, and also provide desired behavior.


### Cluster testing framework based on gluster-tester

Repo: https://github.com/aravindavk/gluster-tester

Build a cluster using docker images (or VMs). Write a tool which would
extend current gluster testing's .t format to take NODE as an addition
parameter to run command. This would make upgrade and downgrade testing
very easy and feasible.

### Network layer changes

Issue: https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/issues/391

There is many improvements we can do in this area
