# Easy Fix Bugs

Fixing easy issues is an excellent method to start contributing patches to Gluster.

Sometimes an *Easy Fix* issue has a patch attached. In those cases,
the *Patch* keyword has been added to the bug. These bugs can be
used by new contributors that would like to verify their workflow. [Bug
1099645](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1099645) is one example of those.

All such issues can be found [here](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/labels/EasyFix)

### Guidelines for new comers

-   While trying to write a patch, do not hesitate to ask questions.
-   If something in the documentation is unclear, we do need to know so
    that we can improve it.
-   There are no stupid questions, and it's more stupid to not ask
    questions that others can easily answer. Always assume that if you
    have a question, someone else would like to hear the answer too.

[Reach out](https://www.gluster.org/community/) to the developers
in #gluster on [Gluster Slack](https://gluster.slack.com) channel, or on
one of the mailing lists, try to keep the discussions public so that anyone
can learn from it.
